    <p>Your session is managed by the <code>mbkauthe</code> library.</p>

    <p>You can click "Logout" in the navigation bar to end your session.</p>

    {# Example: Add a button that triggers the logout JS explicitly #}
    {# <button id="logoutButton">Logout Now</button> #}

{# No extra JS needed here as logout is handled by the base template's navbar JS #}
